# WeatherPy and VacationPy.
---
**Brief Description**: This challenge uses public API/s to analyze and produce insights for two separate deliverables as outlined below:
> - *WeatherPy* - A visual analysis of weather patterns across more than 500 cities worldwide with varying distances from the equator.
> - *VacationPy* - A visual analysis of a global city heatmap that is used to plan vacations based on user-defined ideal weather conditions.<br>

**API/s**: The following two API/s are used for this challenge:
> - *OpenWeatherMapAPI* - This is used to create a representative model of weather across more than 500 cities globally.
> - *GeoapifyAPI* - This is used to create heatmap visualizations that help provide insights on desired vacation spots based on a specific coordinates and category preferences.<br>

**Outputs**: The challenge is split across the following tasks organized into the corresponding Jupyter Notebook file for each activity.<br>
> - *WeatherPy*: Plotting the relationship between weather variables and latitude and the corresponding linear regression for each. 
> - *VacationPy*: Creating map visualizations based on Geoviews Python Library and GeoapifyAPI to plan future vacations.<br>
